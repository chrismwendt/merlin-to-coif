# Merlin -> CoIF

This converts intermediate files generated by [Merlin's `lsif` subcommand from @rvantonder's fork](https://github.com/rvantonder/merlin/pull/3) into CoIF (similar to LSIF, but simpler).

Later, the CoIF file can be converted to LSIF with [coif-to-lsif](https://github.com/sourcegraph/coif-to-lsif).

See https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/issues/1017
